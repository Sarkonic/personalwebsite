<h1>Useful PowerShell Scripts</h1>
<h4>These are some scripts I have used to help with task sequences, automation, or for making things easy.</h4>
<br><br>
<h1>Password Reset GUI</h1>
<p>Simple GUI for me to reference an OU in Active Directory to reset the passwords for those users. This saves time in trying to search through Active Directory
several times a day.</p>

<h1>Copy Shortcuts to Public Desktop</h1>
<p>This script was used in some task sequences for SCCM to copy application shortcuts (Outlook, Excel, etc.) to the public desktop for all users.</p>

<h1>Check for BIOS Password and Remove</h1>
<p>This script uses DellSMBIOS to check for a BIOS password and attempts to remove it. It needs an existing BIOS password, and at the time we
were unsure of what it was and so tried a few possibilities. This also creates a new local admin account.</p>

    </code>
  </pre>

<h1>Crypto Checker: CoinGeckoAPI</h1>
<p>This script uses a crypto API to reference prices of crypto currency. This wasn't for work: it was just made for fun and to check crypto prices if I was too lazy to google it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
    <code>
        {{snippet4}}
    </code>
  </pre>
</blockquote>

<h1>Get Computer Info</h1>
<p>This script takes the name of a domain computer and ouputs some useful information about it</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
    <code>
        {{snippet5}}
    </code>

<h1>Testing PowerShell under a System Authority</h1>
<p>PsExec Tool to test under System
<blockquote>
  <pre>
    <code>

    </code>
  </pre>

<h1>Register a Task to Run an msi file</h1>
<p>This registers a task to run a copied msi file at logon of a user --useful for self updating programs. This saved me
and my team from having to run manual updates on over 90 machines.
